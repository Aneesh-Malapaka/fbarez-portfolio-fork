<!-- ## **research interests**

I am primarily interested in the decision-making and control of robots in human environments.
These days, my efforts are focused on designing perception-based systems for contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as articulated object interaction with mobile manipulators and in-hand manipulation.
Other areas of interest include hierarchical reinforcement learning, optimal control, and 3D vision. -->
