I am a PhD student at [Edinburgh Centre For Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/) under the supervision of Vaishak Belle and Ekaterina Komendantskaya. Prior to this I did Economics & Data Science.

Broadly, I am interested in Economics, Psychology, Mathematics and Philosophy. The main focus of my research is on Constrained Machine Learning for Robustness and Interpretability.

From July 20 to Feb 21, I was a research intern at Huawei Research Labs under the supervision of [Dr. Jeff Pan](http://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/).
