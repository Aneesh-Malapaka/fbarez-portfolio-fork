Hi! My name is Fazl-Kiko. I am a PhD researcher at Edinburgh Centre For Robotics and visiting PhD Scholar at University of Oxford. I am also a research affiliate at [CSER at University of Cambridge](https://www.cser.ac.uk/team/fazl-barez/) and AI safety community researcher at  [Future of Life Institue](https://futureoflife.org/person/fazl-barez/). Previously, I worked as a data scientist at RBS and The Data Lab Innovation Centre.

<br />
Broadly, I am interested in Applications of Safety and Interpretability in Machine Learning. I am also interested in AGI safety and governance. 

From Sep 21 to Apr 22, I was an Applied Science Intern at Amazon working on interpretability and from July 20 to Feb 21, I was a research intern at Huawei Research Labs working on spatial recommender systems.

<br/> 
Outside research, I co-founded [AI Safety Hub Edinburgh](https://aished.org) and help run [AI Safety Hub](https://www.aisafetyhub.org) and [Apart Research](https://apartresearch.com). Previously, I Co-Founded [EA Edinburgh](http://eaedinburgh.com) and now act as a senior advisor.
