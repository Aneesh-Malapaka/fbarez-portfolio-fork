Hi! my name is Fazl. I am a PhD researcher at [Edinburgh Centre For Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/). Prior to this, I worked as a data scientist at [RBS](https://www.rbs.co.uk) and [The DataLab](https://thedatalab.com). 
<br />
Broadly, I am interested in Economics, Psychology, Mathematics and Philosophy. The main focus of my research is on Constrained Machine Learning for Robustness and Interpretability. 

Currently, I am an Applied Machine Learning Science Intern at Amazon working on interpretability and fairness with [Dr. John Pate](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=l_PGy9MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).<br /> 
From July 20 to Feb 21, I was a research intern at Huawei Research Labs working on spatial recommender systems  with [Dr. Giorgos Stoilos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xpZ5n80AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Jeff Pan](http://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/).
